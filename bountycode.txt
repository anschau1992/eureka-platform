[b][size=14pt]TOTAL BOUNTY POOL = 5% OF ALL MINTED EUREKA TOKENS.[/size][/b]

The Bounty campaign will start on 21 November 2018, and will run for 90 days.

The distribution of all the award will take place maximum 4 weeks after the public token sale has ended to campaign participants.

Multiple accounts owned by the same person are not permitted. Any bots or fake accounts are not allowed.

If we detect a low quality or spam account, then this will be excluded from the bounty campaign. If the bounty manager decides an account is low quality a reduced bounty may be paid instead of excluding the account. This is at the bounty manager’s discretion and their decision is final.

You are advised to check the dashboard for any errors and news, several times a week. If you do not correct the errors on time, then you risk your work not being counted.

[b]Server time is UTC +0.[/b]

*EUREKA reserves the right to make amendments to the bounty program at any time (your current stakes will not be reduced).

*EUREKA reserves the right to remove stakes/participants from the bounty for any reason such as unethical behaviour and fraudulent submissions.

[size=12pt][b]Rules, Terms and Conditions[/b][/size]:

[list]
[li]Translation should represent original work. We will ask native speakers to check all translations, so if you use tools such as Google translate or other machine translators your submissions will be rejected and you will be blacklisted.[/li]
[li]For stake counting, only the posts by the official moderator chosen by EUREKA will be counted towards Moderation activity. All Translators must be active, therefore if an official translator becomes inactive, another Moderator will be hired to post updates and to moderate the thread and channel. To remain active, one post or reply to a post per day is needed, unless there are no posts by other users on that day.[/li]
[li]You must not post unnecessary posts to increase your stake numbers. These will result in your posts not being counted and a we may apply a penalty. If you increase your post counts by making unnecessary posts which are not allowed, these posts will not be counted.[/li]
[li]Newbies and users with no previous experience of translation will not be accepted. Please always ask the bounty manager before beginning any translation work, and please post links to your previous translation work so we can verify your experience.[/li]
[li][b]Translations without reserving and being confirmed as the translator for your language are not allowed. We are not responsible for paying for any translations which are worked on without asking us first and getting written approval.[/b][/li]
[li]If a translator fails to keep the thread and channel active and updated, their reward can be reduced by 50% of the actual payment, and in some cases, they can be disqualified.[/li]
[li]The Bounty Manager and the EUREKA Team reserve the right to make changes to these terms or apply new ones at any time.[/li]
[li]After you receive our approval, you have five (5) days to complete ANN/One Pager/Website/Your Language Telegram Channel and ten (30) days to complete the translation of our Whitepaper.[/li]
